color.alphaType 		int 	 	1	By default (0), uses the alpha type reported by the incoming
										image. Otherwise, 1 means the alpha is premultiplied, 0
										means the incoming alpha is unpremultiplied.
color.normalize 		int 	 	1	Non-0 means to normalize the incoming pixels to [0,1]
color.logtype 			int 	 	1	The default (0), means no log to linear transform, 1 uses the
										cineon transform (see cineon.whiteCodeValue and
										cineon.blackCodeValue below) and 1 means use the Viper
										camera log to linear transform.
color.invert 			int 	 	1	If non-0, invert the image color using the inversion matrix
										(See User's Manual)
color.sRGB2linear 		int 	 	1	If the value is non-0, convert the incoming pixels from sRGB
										space to linear space
color.Rec709ToLinear 	int 	 	1	If the value is non-0, convert the incoming pixels using the
										inverse of the Rec709 transfer function
color.gamma 			float[3] 	1 	Apply a gamma. The default is [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]. The three
										values are applied to R G and B channels independently.
color.fileGamma 		float 		1 	Apply a gamma to linearize the incoming image. The default
										is 1.0.
color.lut 								Not currently used
color.offset 			float[3]    1   Color bias added to incoming color channels. Default = 0 (not
										bias). Each component is applied to R G B independently.
color.exposure 			float[3] 	1 	Relative exposure in stops. Default = [0, 0, 0], See user's
										manual for more information on this. Each component is
										applied to R G and B independently.
color.contrast 			float[3] 	1 	Contrast applied per channel (see User's Manual)
color.saturation 		float 		1 	Relative saturation (see User's Manual)
color.hue 				float 		1 	Hue rotation in radians (see User's Manual)
color.active 			int 		1 	If 0, do not apply any color transforms. Disables the node.
color.ignoreChromaticities 	int 	1 	If non-0, ignore any non-Rec 709 chromaticities reported by
